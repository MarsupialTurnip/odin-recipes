# odin-recipes
This is my first project with 'The Odin Project'.
I spent the last month or two playing with app lessons in Javascript, and working on a microbachelor program from IBM and EDX.
But I found the microbachelor very boring and not an entertaining way to learn. 
So I switched to The Odin Project, I have tried to start coding many times. But most recently with my sons birth two years ago. THen now with my wifes pregnancy with my daughter. 
I am no longer learning to just code. I am learning how to create in the world I love most. 

This project will show my ability to make an HTML boilerplate, to create organized and unorganized lists, my basic understand of the <html> syntax as well as my understanding of git
and git hub.
